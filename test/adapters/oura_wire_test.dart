// The Oura wire format, against real captured bytes.
//
// THE FIXTURE IS GROUND TRUTH, AND IT IS NARROW. Every `debug_data` body below
// is verbatim from a 10,208-record capture off a real ring, and the expectations
// are what an independent read of that capture supports — nothing here was
// copied from anyone's decoder. The battery numbers in particular are checked
// two ways: the ring reports its voltage in two unrelated sub-records at two
// different cadences, and where they land near each other in the capture they
// agree to within 3 mV. That agreement is the evidence; a single decoder
// agreeing with itself would not be.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE, said out loud because a fixture presented as a
// correctness credential is a liability (ADDING_A_DEVICE 6.2): it proves
// determinism, regression and physiological sanity. It does not prove
// correctness, because there is no independent oracle for this band — nobody
// on this project owns a ring. The decoders that are NOT here (beat intervals,
// SpO2, hypnogram, steps) are absent precisely because there are no bytes to
// build such a fixture from, and shipping a guess would have this file
// faithfully encoding the wrong answer.
//
// The NULL cases at the bottom are the load-bearing half: they are what proves
// the decoder REFUSES rather than always producing something.
