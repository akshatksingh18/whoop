// SyncDot — the quietest possible "data is arriving".
//
// From TestFlight: "don't get to know if syncing is happening or not". The sync
// is deliberately invisible in this app — no progress bars, no spinners, no
// "syncing…" copy — and that is the right default, because the band syncs
// constantly and a user cannot act on any of it. But invisible and broken look
// identical, which is what the report is really about.
//
// So: a 6pt dot beside the title that breathes while records are landing, and
// is absent otherwise. No text, no layout shift (the space is held either way),
// nothing to dismiss. If you are not looking for it you will not notice it; if
// you are wondering whether the thing works, it answers you.
