// The HOST for a standard Bluetooth heart-rate sensor: connect it, drive
// [BleHrsAdapter] over the link, and write what comes back into the substrate.
//
// WHAT MOVED, AND WHY IT MATTERS. The decode and the session used to be in
// this file. They are now `adapters/ble_hrs.dart` — a 40-line
// `Stream<BandEvent> run(BandLink)` — and everything left here is host work a
// contributor must never see: `flutter_blue_plus`, the paired-device row,
// `sqflite`, the per-second write buffer, `device_id` discipline. The seam
// between the two halves is `adapters/adapter.dart`, and this is its first
// caller.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT.
//  * NOT a background source. Armed by a workout, disarmed when the workout
//    ends — the same rule GPS follows, for the same reason: a second GATT link
//    held open all day is a battery cost and a scan/connect fight with the
//    band's own link.
//  * NOT better than the band overnight. A chest strap is better at exercise
//    HR and beat timing; that is the whole of the claim.
//  * NOT baseline input, and not yet input to anything. Its rows land in
//    `decoded_onehz` / `decoded_rr` — the real substrate, not a side table —
//    stamped `source = 'ble_hrs'`, and every derive/export read filters
//    `source IS NULL`. Resting HR from a chest strap and from wrist PPG differ
//    systematically, and merging them quietly is how a step change lands in
//    every long-horizon number with no visible cause.
//  * REACHABLE NOW, and it was not. [scanFor] finds a sensor and
//    [pairNotifySensor] writes the `device` row [HrsLink.arm] reads, so
//    arming stops being a no-op the moment a user picks one.
//    `lib/ui2/profile/pair_sensor.dart` is the screen that drives both.
//  * NOT hardware-verified. Nobody on this project owns a strap. Everything
//    below is verified by the SIG spec, the fixtures in
//    `test/hrs_link_test.dart` and the compiler. It ships EXPERIMENTAL
//    (ASSUMPTIONS R6).
//
// BEAT TIME. A 0x2A37 strap reports beat-to-beat DURATIONS and carries no
// clock. The durations are exact and land in `decoded_rr.rr_ms`; the only time
// we can attach is the arrival of the notification, which BLE delivery jitter
// and stack batching move by tens of milliseconds. That anchor goes in
// `rr_ts_ms` (the whole-second column, which is what it is) and `beat_ts_ms` —
// the column that means "where the beat actually WAS" — stays NULL, because we
// do not know. `TimeAnchor.arrival` on the registry entry is the machine-
// readable form of that sentence: RMSSD and pNN50 are correct on it,
// Lomb-Scargle / `cvhr_per_hour` / `spanSec` must refuse on it.
