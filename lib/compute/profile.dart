//
// Sourced from AppState's local profile map (shared_preferences). Algorithms
// that NEED a field (HRmax via Tanaka, Keytel calories, TRIMP sex constant,
// fitness-age) read it from here; algorithms that don't simply ignore it.
//
// HONESTY: a missing field => the DEPENDENT metric must return null+confidence 0
// (never a fabricated default). The engine therefore passes nullable getters and
// only computes profile-gated metrics when the input is present.
