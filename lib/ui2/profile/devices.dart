// Sources, not "devices".
//
// This is where the band-agnostic thesis has to be legible, because this is
// where someone goes to ask "which of my things is this number coming from?".
//
// The answer is a quality ladder, and the ordering rule is the inverse of the
// platform health stores: Apple Health and Health Connect rank by whatever
// wrote last (with a manual priority list bolted on top), so a phone's step
// estimate can quietly outrank a chest strap. Here the better sensor wins and
// recency only breaks a tie within a tier. There is no user preference and the
// screen no longer claims one — no control ever set an order.
//
// TWO BUCKETS AND ONLY TWO: what is measuring, and what is NOT YET — the
// second with a reason and a PERMANENCE beside it. "Not yet" without a
// permanence becomes a lie by slow motion: "no, an iPhone has no ANT radio" is
// a different statement from "not yet, a few weeks". There is deliberately no
// third "imported" tier; bringing a history in is data adoption, not device
// support, and it never appears on a compatibility list.
//
// A tier rung is drawn when something in it exists. Tier 1 is now reachable —
// a standard Bluetooth heart-rate sensor can be paired from this screen — so it
// is no longer named in the NOT YET list. What it CANNOT do is stated on the
// sensor's own row instead: it captures beats during a workout and nothing
// derives from it yet, because no one on this project has held one
// (ASSUMPTIONS R6).
