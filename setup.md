# WHOOP development and recovery

**Status:** Ownership cleanup is in progress on `ownership-cleanup`. The new history has not
replaced GitHub main. Full Linux run 40529212076 passes COV-44, COV-42, all 24 COV-43 controls and approved Food A; remaining coverage,
migration builds and phone acceptance remain open.

## Correct checkout

On this laptop use `C:\AI Important Files\personal-project\whoop\build\worktrees\build95-repairs`.
Its folder name is historical. The preserved project-root checkout remains on `build-90-codex`.
The cleanup branch starts at `b9f2532d` on `coverage-expansion`; the last confirmed published
coverage checkpoint is `050ae04e`. Preserve newer work rather than resetting to either revision.
Check `git branch --show-current`, `git status` and `pubspec.yaml` before reporting status.

App metadata remains `0.9.69+102`, algorithm 99, schema 50. Cached Build 102 was built from
`fc69b0d3`; later coverage repairs and ownership edits are not in that IPA. Build 91 is the
last reported install; confirm the phone's actual About/version separately. Build 70 remains
the accepted recovery artifact. No cache promotion or signing enrollment is claimed here.

## Toolchain and checks

The workspace development toolchain is under `personal-project/dev/`; resolve it from the
workspace, not relative to this deeply nested checkout. CI pins Flutter 3.41.6. Full suites,
whole-project analysis and native builds run on Actions. Local checks are a few targeted files
or short Python probes. `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs both package suites, app analysis,
instrumented tests and synthetic full-page captures; `personal-ios.yml` is manual only.
The internal package digest/version guard is `tool/algorithm_contract.py` and
`packages/algorithm-contract.json`. Review output/version implications before updating digests.
No floating Git dependency, local dependency override or external revision probe is permitted.

On Windows, native hooks can fail under paths with spaces. For targeted probes only, use
temporary unused drive aliases for this checkout and the installed Flutter SDK, remove them
in `finally`, and regenerate package configuration against the real path afterwards. Never
leave a long-running test or temporary drive mapping behind.

Continuation is manual in sessions Akshat starts/resumes; no unattended follow-up automation is
active for this work. Begin by checking the latest run recorded below, then inspect newer source.

Native/IPA builds remain held until coverage work is complete. Akshat approved coverage completion before build N while retaining that hold. Then resume
ownership migration/native verification; the GitHub replacement STOP remains. Do not dispatch a native build or bump metadata to bypass that hold.

## Repository and private recovery

`origin` is `https://github.com/akshatksingh18/whoop.git`; `local-backup` is
`C:\Users\aksha\git-remotes\whoop.git`. Only these remotes remain. Local source cleanup commit: `ce2202d0` (owned identities, preserved runtime aliases and
internal algorithm guard). Documentation/privacy changes are batched separately.
Only reviewed parentless CI candidates have been pushed, using public-safe noreply identity
and no preservation ancestors. GitHub main, existing branches and tags remain untouched.
Read-only GitHub checks confirm the repository belongs to the authenticated account.
The fully verified candidate is parentless `c640c84ecd4d58d1a0ea675489c6bc79ec853d67` on
`ownership-ci-candidate-9`, source `3b8e730c`, tree `9ec667747d581824959f83fe0df2203e56040c5f`.
Full Linux run [40529212076](https://github.com/akshatksingh18/whoop/actions/runs/40529212076)
passes app/packages/analysis/page jobs: 4,497 app checks, 432 explicit skips and 708 synthetic
captures. COV-44 contributes 272 passing checks and 1,450 newly executed production lines.
The inventory is 44,174/50,357 handwritten lines (87.72%; 6,183 unexecuted), with all 203
normalized source hashes matching, no lost line hits and an unchanged denominator versus
candidate 8. Exact LCOV/gap/delta receipts are in `build/ownership-checkpoint/cov44-linux-verified/`.
COV-42, all 24 COV-43 controls and approved Food A retain combined verification; the Food
large-text regression is enabled and passes. Coverage as a whole and current-tail/reconnect
ownership remain open. Two existing backup-feedback/device-rename defects are retained as
three explicit regression skips in `bugs.md`. Production behavior, calculations, UI, metadata,
schema and active identities are unchanged by COV-44. The tested tree has no private ancestors.

COV-45 is the next locally prepared batch: 52 authored controls and a background-startup
ownership repair, with full Linux verification pending. It does not implement active identity
migration or resolve the separate current-tail failed-banking limitation. COV-44 above stays
the last fully verified inventory until a new run and matching-source comparison are recorded.

Approved capture substitutions and copied call sites are implemented; `privacy-fixture-review.md`
owns their provenance and private retention. Two JSON oracles already have
verified local-only copies and optional replay, plus independent public synthetic controls.
This branch also has private preservation ancestors: never push it. A later candidate must
send only reviewed content with fresh ancestry and a public-safe commit identity.

All previous histories are still local. The three preservation commits are:

- `0b3817a8642d3bc495e2c4fb5b20913b845d33e6` on historical `build-90-codex`.
- `f1d5689eca94e4b96149e9e00095fe1806350653` on local-only `preserve/local-design-tooling`.
- `b9f2532d7388605496291ee9f5b4fc6379493ab5` on `coverage-expansion`.

Verified all-ref bundles and loose-file manifests are in ignored `build/ownership-checkpoint/`.
Keep the original repositories as well: bundles do not preserve every reflog-only object.
`archive/pre-rewrite-main` remains local only. Never mirror-push archives or preservation refs.
The independently verified local-only vault snapshot is
`C:\AI Local Only\inventories\whoop-pre-fresh-start` (16,124 files, zero check differences).
The later review snapshot is `C:\AI Local Only\inventories\whoop-ownership-review`.
These snapshots precede the source cleanup; refresh preservation before destructive publication.
The original laptop's D:-based checkout and bare backup require their own verified archives.
Current cleanup recovery uses verified all-ref bundles in `build/ownership-checkpoint/`;
`cleanup-final-receipt.json` records the `b53d2f9b` checkpoint; the later verified
`pre-ci-fixture-all-refs.bundle` preserves local source through `2ab7577f` (SHA-256
`f6107e13a9283ad82a1ec5a1849228ebd1f0acf473dffc56469727f268aaef43`).
`ci-candidate*.json` records the separate public root candidates. The current verified
source/CI archive receipt is `cov44-session-preservation-receipt.json`, alongside prior checkpoint
receipts and all-ref bundles. It records its exact head, bundle filename, size and SHA-256;
verify it rather than assuming that an older receipt covers later edits. The post-COV-40
checkpoint at `0d8b2e2b` is independently preserved in `post-cov40-state-all-refs.bundle`
(SHA-256 `94d6de093cfab6adc27e58f4249cb745d21f607f3b16a34bc971b62c5df15d7e`).
The isolated vault snapshot `C:\AI Local Only\inventories\whoop-ownership-cleanup` includes
those bundles, exact old docs and captured protocol oracles. Its manifest owns current file
counts; independent collector checks must show zero differences before proceeding. Earlier
snapshots remain unchanged. Refresh the scoped snapshot again before destructive publication.
These archives remain local only.

Exact earlier build/audit/research records, original completed tracker and personal worked
examples remain in the private pre-fresh-start archives. Current edited originals were copied
and SHA-256 verified in `build/ownership-checkpoint/private-reference-docs/manifest.json` before
being removed from the proposed public tree. `pre-cleanup-docs/` retains the earlier bytes too.
These files and local tooling/health captures must not be pushed. The current TODO consolidates
open work without reopening finished repairs. Backup registration/vault collection must include
new private evidence; a Git clone does not recover it.

## Deployment

The personal source ships Runner and RunnerTests only, no extensions, Watch or Android target.
Preserve the bundle/signing identity, encrypted export formats and OS-held restoration state.
The payload validator enforces empty entitlements, capability exclusions and background modes.
See the two iOS guides for signing, backup, upgrade and physical acceptance gates.
