// noop_import.dart — import a NOOP raw-sensor CSV export into the local store.
//
// The NOOP export is LONG-FORMAT raw 1 Hz: one row per decoded sample, with a
// `stream` discriminator and only that stream's columns filled. Columns are read
// by NAME from the header, never by fixed position — NOOP has already shipped one
// schema change (see below) and name-keyed reads absorbed it without misparsing.
//
// SCHEMA AS SHIPPED (observed 2026-08, NOOP 9.1/9.2 — OpenStrap/edge#160):
//   unix_s,iso_utc,stream,hr_bpm,rr_ms,grav_x,grav_y,grav_z,step_counter,
//   ppg_bpm,ppg_conf,spo2_red,spo2_ir,skintemp_raw,resp_raw,band_sleep_state,
//   event_kind,event_payload
// `band_sleep_state` was INSERTED at index 15, shifting event_kind/event_payload
// to 16/17 (the older documented layout, still in [_defaultCols], ends at
// event_payload=16). Streams now seen: hr, rr, gravity, skintemp, steps,
// band_sleep_state, ppghr, event. Note `spo2` and `resp` rows are no longer
// emitted at all even though their columns survive in the header.
//
// WHAT WE CONSUME, AND WHY NOT THE REST:
//   • hr / rr / gravity / skintemp / spo2 → the Substrate (full 1 Hz analytics).
//   • steps → `live_coverage` as a REAL step count (see [_flushStepCoverage]).
//   • band_sleep_state → deliberately ignored. `segmentSleep` is the single sleep
//     source (a second one would contradict it), and in the real #160 export this
//     column was constant 0 across all 12,663 rows — no signal to gain.
//   • ppghr → deliberately ignored. The `hr` stream already covers every second
//     the export carries, and PPG-derived HR is not trusted as a substitute.
//   • resp_raw → ignored; respiration rate is derived from RR downstream.
// An unrecognised future `stream` also lands in the default branch and is skipped
// safely, so a further NOOP schema change degrades rather than throws.
//
// Because this is RAW 1 Hz — the SAME signal family as our own Substrate — we run
// it through the FULL local pipeline (full-fidelity analytics, identical to a live
// band sync), NOT degraded snapshots.
//
// LARGE FILES: a 90-day export is hundreds of MB / tens of millions of rows, so we
// NEVER load the file or build one big Substrate. We STREAM the file and derive in
// a 2-day sliding window (the day model needs the prior evening for a sleep that
// starts before midnight), writing + freeing each day as we go. Memory stays flat
// (~2 days) regardless of file size.
