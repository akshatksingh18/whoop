// STEPS — hybrid pedometry for a wrist that gives us TWO different streams.
//
// The honest constraint (see motion.dart §"what 1 Hz accel CANNOT do"):
//   * The always-on 24/7 substrate is 1 Hz accel. Human gait is 1.4–2.5 Hz, far
//     above the 0.5 Hz Nyquist limit of a 1 Hz stream — so you CANNOT count
//     individual steps from the stored substrate. Full stop.
//   * Real per-step detection is only possible on the ~100 Hz foreground accel
//     (R10 / 0x2B), which exists only while the app is connected and streaming.
//
// So we split the problem the only honest way:
//
//   TIER A — [pedometer] / [livePedometer]: a real step counter on the 100 Hz
//     foreground stream. The locked Analog Devices AN-2554 "full step detection"
//     algorithm, ported VERBATIM from the OpenStrap backend
//     (openstrap-analytics/src/steps.ts) where it was calibrated on a 100-step
//     ground-truth walk (raw ×1.11 gain). Its CONFIRM=8 regularity gate rejects
//     waving/typing/handling and reads 0 at rest. Directly testable: walk N
//     steps with the app open and compare.
//
//   TIER B — [dailyStepEstimate]: a 24/7 estimate from the 1 Hz substrate. We
//     cannot count steps, so the PRIMARY quantity we report is the one that IS
//     resolvable at 1 Hz: ACTIVE (ambulatory) MINUTES. Steps are then reported
//     as a RANGE, minutes × the free-living cadence band (Tudor-Locke 2011,
//     ~100–130 steps/min), never as a single fabricated-precision number.
//
//     Three things make the minute detector stable, and all three matter:
//       1. The feature is [MotionMinute.dynAmp] — per-axis high-passed dynamic
//          amplitude — NOT ENMO. ENMO depends on a scalar gravity reference
//          whose per-day estimate moves by about the same amount as the signal
//          being measured, so an absolute cut-point on ENMO is not stable
//          across days. dynAmp removes gravity as a vector and is invariant to
//          per-axis offset. (Vähä-Ypyä 2015 argues for calibration-robust
//          amplitude measures over ENMO for exactly this reason.)
//       2. The cut-point is a MULTI-DAY PERSONAL REFERENCE ([personalDynFloor],
//          a quantile of the user's POOLED trailing dynAmp minutes) — neither
//          an absolute g constant (calibration-fragile) nor a same-day relative
//          baseline (which collapses on a quiet day and then passes
//          everything). One floor, computed over enough history to be stable,
//          applied to every day.
//       3. Corroboration + duration: HR must be lifted off rest when HR is
//          available, and a minute only counts inside a run of consecutive
//          ambulatory minutes.
//
//     With no personal reference the estimator ABSTAINS (absent Metric with a
//     `need_baseline:` note). It never substitutes a constant — substituting a
//     constant IS the failure mode this design exists to prevent.
//
//   CALIBRATION — [StepCalibration] / [calibrateCadence]: Tier A is also Tier
//     B's teacher. When live walking data exists we measure THIS user's real
//     cadence, and that measured cadence NARROWS the reported step band. It is
//     used only where it is real (cadence, from a 100 Hz count); it is never
//     extrapolated into a per-minute cadence regression, because 1 Hz cannot
//     resolve cadence at all (gait 1.4–2.5 Hz; 2.0 Hz aliases exactly to DC).
//
// Pure: dart:math only. No I/O, no clock, no randomness.

// ───────────────────────── TIER B: 1 Hz daily estimate ──────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS LOOKS THE WAY IT DOES — the two anchors that DON'T work:
//
//   (a) An ABSOLUTE g cut-point on ENMO. ENMO = max(0, ‖a‖ − gRef), and gRef is
//       estimated per-day from the stillest samples. On a wrist those are the
//       sleep block, whose orientation differs from the waking day; with a few
//       percent of per-axis gain/offset error the still ‖a‖ can differ by
//       ~0.05 g between postures. That bias is added to EVERY waking minute,
//       and it is the same size as the walking signal itself. Sweeping gRef
//       over one real day's raw data moved the daily total from ~42 000 steps
//       to 0 with no stable plateau in between — SNR ≈ 1 by construction.
//
//   (b) A SAME-DAY RELATIVE baseline (e.g. today's p20 + k·MAD). This fails in
//       mirror image: on a genuinely quiet day the baseline collapses toward
//       zero, the floor collapses with it, and ordinary sedentary minutes clear
//       it. Same real day, same failure magnitude, opposite direction.
//
// What DOES work is a MULTI-DAY PERSONAL REFERENCE on a calibration-invariant
// feature: one floor derived from the POOLED distribution of the user's
// [MotionMinute.dynAmp] minutes across trailing history, applied to every day.
// It is stable because it is estimated from thousands of minutes, and it is
// invariant to sensor drift because dynAmp is (see enmo.dart).
//
// And when there is not enough history to estimate that floor, we ABSTAIN.
